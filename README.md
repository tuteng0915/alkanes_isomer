# Alkane Isomer Simulation

This project simulates the generation and exploration of isomers of alkanes.

## Features

- **Isomer Generation:** Generates isomers for alkanes based on the number of carbon atoms.
- **Substituent Support:** Supports multiple substituent groups, each with specific properties like balance and mass.
- **Modes:** 
  - Mode A: Search for isomers of a specified alkane.
  - Mode B: Display each isomer, show all isomers, or show isomer counts for each main chain length.
- **Output:** Results are printed to the console and saved to an output text file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- No additional dependencies required beyond standard Python libraries.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tuteng0915/alkane_isomer.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
    cd alkane_isomer
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
    pip install numpy
```

## Usage

1. Run the program:
```bash
   python alkane_isomer_simulation.py
```

2. The program will prompt you to input the total number of carbons for the alkane.

3. Results will be saved in `output.txt`.
